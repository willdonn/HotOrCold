# HotOrCold
Algorithm implemented in Java that guesses a random number in the range [1, n] in log n time. The hot or cold game takes three arguments (previous guess, next guess, and the computer's randomly generated number) and returns hotter if the guess is closer (or equally close) than the previous guess, colder if it is further away, and game over if the guess is correct.
